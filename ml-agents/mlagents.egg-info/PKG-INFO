Description: # Unity ML-Agents Python Interface and Trainers
        
        The `mlagents` Python package is part of the
        [ML-Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).
        `mlagents` provides a Python API that allows direct interaction with the Unity
        game engine as well as a collection of trainers and algorithms to train agents
        in Unity environments.
        
        The `mlagents` Python package contains two sub packages:
        
        * `mlagents_envs`: A low level API which allows you to interact directly with a
          Unity Environment. See
          [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Python-API.md)
          for more information on using this package.
        
        * `mlagents.trainers`: A set of Reinforcement Learning algorithms designed to be
          used with Unity environments. Access them using the: `mlagents-learn` access
          point. See
          [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-ML-Agents.md)
          for more information on using this package.
