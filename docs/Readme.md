## Translations

To make the Unity ML-Agents toolkit accessible to the global research and
Unity developer communities, we're attempting to create and maintain
translations of our documentation. We've started with translating a subset
of the documentation to one language (Chinese), but we hope to continue
translating more pages and to other languages. Consequently,
we welcome any enhancements and improvements from the community.

* [Korean](localized/KR/)

## Deprecated Docs
We no longer use them ourselves and so they may not be up-to-date.
We've decided to keep them up just in case they are helpful to you.
