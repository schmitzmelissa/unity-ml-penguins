# Agents

An agent is an actor that can observe its environment and decide on the best
course of action using those observations. Create Agents in Unity by extending
the Agent class. The most important aspects of creating agents that can
successfully learn are the observations the agent collects for
reinforcement learning and the reward you assign to estimate the value of the
agent's current state toward accomplishing its tasks.

An Agent passes its observations to its Policy. The Policy, then, makes a decision
and passes the chosen action back to the agent. Your agent code must execute the
action, for example, move the agent in one direction or another. In order to
[train an agent using reinforcement learning](Learning-Environment-Design.md),
your agent must calculate a reward value at each action. The reward is used to
discover the optimal decision-making policy.

The Policy class abstracts out the decision making logic from the Agent itself so
that you can use the same Policy in multiple Agents. How a Policy makes its
decisions depends on the kind of Policy it is. You can change the Policy of an
Agent by changing its `Behavior Parameters`. If you set `Behavior Type` to
`Heuristic Only`, the Agent will use its `Heuristic()` method to make decisions
which can allow you to control the Agent manually or write your own Policy. If
the Agent has a `Model` file, it Policy will use the neural network `Model` to
take decisions.

## Decisions

The observation-decision-action-reward cycle repeats each time the Agent request
a decision.
Agents will request a decision when `Agent.RequestDecision()` is called. If you need
the Agent to request decisions on its own at regular intervals, add a
`Decision Requester` component to the Agent's Game Object. Making decisions at regular step
intervals is generally most appropriate for physics-based simulations. For example, an
agent in a robotic simulator that must provide fine-control of joint torques
should make its decisions every step of the simulation. On the other hand, an
agent that only needs to make decisions when certain game or simulation events
occur, should call `Agent.RequestDecision()` manually.

## Observations

To make decisions, an agent must observe its environment in order to infer the
state of the world. A state observation can take the following forms:

* **Vector Observation** — a feature vector consisting of an array of floating
  point numbers.
* **Visual Observations** — one or more camera images and/or render textures.

When you use vector observations for an Agent, implement the
`Agent.CollectObservations(VectorSensor sensor)` method to create the feature vector. When you use
**Visual Observations**, you only need to identify which Unity Camera objects
or RenderTextures will provide images and the base Agent class handles the rest.
You do not need to implement the `CollectObservations(VectorSensor sensor)` method when your Agent
uses visual observations (unless it also uses vector observations).

### Vector Observation Space: Feature Vectors

For agents using a continuous state space, you create a feature vector to
represent the agent's observation at each step of the simulation. The Policy
class calls the `CollectObservations(VectorSensor sensor)` method of each Agent. Your
implementation of this function must call `VectorSensor.AddObservation` to add vector
observations.

The observation must include all the information an agents needs to accomplish
its task. Without sufficient and relevant information, an agent may learn poorly
or may not learn at all. A reasonable approach for determining what information
should be included is to consider what you would need to calculate an analytical
solution to the problem.

For examples of various state observation functions, you can look at the
[example environments](Learning-Environment-Examples.md) included in the
ML-Agents SDK.  For instance, the 3DBall example uses the rotation of the
platform, the relative position of the ball, and the velocity of the ball as its
state observation. As an experiment, you can remove the velocity components from
the observation and retrain the 3DBall agent. While it will learn to balance the
ball reasonably well, the performance of the agent without using velocity is
noticeably worse.

```csharp
public GameObject ball;

private List<float> state = new List<float>();
public override void CollectObservations(VectorSensor sensor)
{
    sensor.AddObservation(gameObject.transform.rotation.z);
    sensor.AddObservation(gameObject.transform.rotation.x);
    sensor.AddObservation((ball.transform.position.x - gameObject.transform.position.x));
    sensor.AddObservation((ball.transform.position.y - gameObject.transform.position.y));
    sensor.AddObservation((ball.transform.position.z - gameObject.transform.position.z));
    sensor.AddObservation(ball.transform.GetComponent<Rigidbody>().velocity.x);
    sensor.AddObservation(ball.transform.GetComponent<Rigidbody>().velocity.y);
    sensor.AddObservation(ball.transform.GetComponent<Rigidbody>().velocity.z);
}
```

The feature vector must always contain the same number of elements and
observations must always be in the same position within the list. If the number
of observed entities in an environment can vary you can pad the feature vector
with zeros for any missing entities in a specific observation or you can limit
an agent's observations to a fixed subset. For example, instead of observing
every enemy agent in an environment, you could only observe the closest five.

When you set up an Agent's `Behavior Parameters` in the Unity Editor, set the following
properties to use a continuous vector observation:

* **Space Size** — The state size must match the length of your feature vector.

The observation feature vector is a list of floating point numbers, which means
you must convert any other data types to a float or a list of floats.

The `VectorSensor.AddObservation` method provides a number of overloads for adding common types
of data to your observation vector. You can add Integers and booleans directly to
the observation vector, as well as some common Unity data types such as `Vector2`,
`Vector3`, and `Quaternion`.

Type enumerations should be encoded in the _one-hot_ style. That is, add an
element to the feature vector for each element of enumeration, setting the
element representing the observed member to one and set the rest to zero. For
example, if your enumeration contains \[Sword, Shield, Bow\] and the agent
observes that the current item is a Bow, you would add the elements: 0, 0, 1 to
the feature vector. The following code example illustrates how to add.

```csharp
enum CarriedItems { Sword, Shield, Bow, LastItem }
private List<float> state = new List<float>();
public override void CollectObservations(VectorSensor sensor)
{
    for (int ci = 0; ci < (int)CarriedItems.LastItem; ci++)
    {
        sensor.AddObservation((int)currentItem == ci ? 1.0f : 0.0f);
    }
}
```

`VectorSensor.AddObservation` also provides a two-argument version as a shortcut for _one-hot_
style observations. The following example is identical to the previous one.

```csharp
enum CarriedItems { Sword, Shield, Bow, LastItem }
const int NUM_ITEM_TYPES = (int)CarriedItems.LastItem;

public override void CollectObservations(VectorSensor sensor)
{
    // The first argument is the selection index; the second is the
    // number of possibilities
    sensor.AddOneHotObservation((int)currentItem, NUM_ITEM_TYPES);
}
```

#### Normalization

For the best results when training, you should normalize the components of your
feature vector to the range [-1, +1] or [0, 1]. When you normalize the values,
the PPO neural network can often converge to a solution faster. Note that it
isn't always necessary to normalize to these recommended ranges, but it is
considered a best practice when using neural networks. The greater the variation
in ranges between the components of your observation, the more likely that
training will be affected.

To normalize a value to [0, 1], you can use the following formula:

```csharp
normalizedValue = (currentValue - minValue)/(maxValue - minValue)
```

Rotations and angles should also be normalized. For angles between 0 and 360
degrees, you can use the following formulas:

```csharp
Quaternion rotation = transform.rotation;
Vector3 normalized = rotation.eulerAngles / 180.0f - Vector3.one;  // [-1,1]
Vector3 normalized = rotation.eulerAngles / 360.0f;  // [0,1]
```

For angles that can be outside the range [0,360], you can either reduce the
angle, or, if the number of turns is significant, increase the maximum value
used in your normalization formula.

### Multiple Visual Observations

Visual observations use rendered textures directly or from one or more
cameras in a scene. The Policy vectorizes the textures into a 3D Tensor which
can be fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN). For more information on
CNNs, see [this guide](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/). You
can use visual observations along side vector observations.

Agents using visual observations can capture state of arbitrary complexity and
are useful when the state is difficult to describe numerically. However, they
are also typically less efficient and slower to train, and sometimes don't
succeed at all.

Visual observations can be derived from Cameras or RenderTextures within your scene.
To add a visual observation to an Agent, add either a Camera Sensor Component
or RenderTextures Sensor Component to the Agent. Then drag the camera or
render texture you want to add to the `Camera` or `RenderTexture` field.
You can have more than one camera or render texture and even use a combination
of both attached to an Agent. For each visual observation, set the width and height
of the image (in pixels) and whether or not the observation is color or grayscale.

![Agent Camera](images/visual-observation.png)

or

![Agent RenderTexture](images/visual-observation-rendertexture.png)

Each Agent that uses the same Policy must have the same number of visual observations,
and they must all have the same resolutions (including whether or not they are grayscale).
Additionally, each Sensor Component on an Agent must have a unique name so that they can
be sorted deterministically (the name must be unique for that Agent, but multiple Agents can
have a Sensor Component with the same name).

When using `RenderTexture` visual observations, a handy feature for debugging is
adding a `Canvas`, then adding a `Raw Image` with it's texture set to the Agent's
`RenderTexture`. This will render the agent observation on the game screen.

![RenderTexture with Raw Image](images/visual-observation-rawimage.png)

The [GridWorld environment](Learning-Environment-Examples.md#gridworld)
is an example on how to use a RenderTexture for both debugging and observation. Note
that in this example, a Camera is rendered to a RenderTexture, which is then used for
observations and debugging. To update the RenderTexture, the Camera must be asked to
render every time a decision is requested within the game code. When using Cameras
as observations directly, this is done automatically by the Agent.

![Agent RenderTexture Debug](images/gridworld.png)

### Raycast Observations
Raycasts are an alternative system for the Agent to provide observations based on
the physical environment. This can be easily implemented by adding a
RayPerceptionSensorComponent3D (or RayPerceptionSensorComponent2D) to the Agent.

During observations, several rays (or spheres, depending on settings) are cast into
the physics world, and the objects that are hit determine the observation vector that
is produced.

![Agent with two RayPerceptionSensorComponent3Ds](images/ray_perception.png)

Both sensor components have several settings:
 * _Detectable Tags_ A list of strings corresponding to the types of objects that the
 Agent should be able to distinguish between. For example, in the WallJump example,
 we use "wall", "goal", and "block" as the list of objects to detect.
 * _Rays Per Direction_ Determines the number of rays that are cast. One ray is
  always cast forward, and this many rays are cast to the left and right.
 * _Max Ray Degrees_ The angle (in degrees) for the outermost rays. 90 degrees
  corresponds to the left and right of the agent.
 * _Sphere Cast Radius_ The size of the sphere used for sphere casting. If set
  to 0, rays will be used instead of spheres. Rays may be more efficient,
  especially in complex scenes.
 * _Ray Length_ The length of the casts
 * _Observation Stacks_ The number of previous results to "stack" with the cast
  results. Note that this can be independent of the "Stacked Vectors" setting
  in `Behavior Parameters`.
 * _Start Vertical Offset_ (3D only) The vertical offset of the ray start point.
 * _End Vertical Offset_ (3D only) The vertical offset of the ray end point.

In the example image above, the Agent has two RayPerceptionSensorComponent3Ds.
Both use 3 Rays Per Direction and 90 Max Ray Degrees. One of the components
had a vertical offset, so the Agent can tell whether it's clear to jump over
the wall.

The total size of the created observations is
```
(Observation Stacks) * (1 + 2 * Rays Per Direction) * (Num Detectable Tags + 2)
```
so the number of rays and tags should be kept as small as possible to reduce the
amount of data used. Note that this is separate from the State Size defined in
`Behavior Parameters`, so you don't need to worry about the formula above when
setting the State Size.

## Vector Actions

An action is an instruction from the Policy that the agent carries out. The
action is passed to the Agent as a parameter when the Academy invokes the
agent's `OnActionReceived()` function. When you specify that the vector action space
is **Continuous**, the action parameter passed to the Agent is an array of
control signals with length equal to the `Vector Action Space Size` property.
When you specify a **Discrete** vector action space type, the action parameter
is an array containing integers. Each integer is an index into a list or table
of commands. In the **Discrete** vector action space type, the action parameter
is an array of indices. The number of indices in the array is determined by the
number of branches defined in the `Branches Size` property. Each branch
corresponds to an action table, you can specify the size of each table by
modifying the `Branches` property.

Neither the Policy nor the training algorithm know anything about what the action
values themselves mean. The training algorithm simply tries different values for
the action list and observes the affect on the accumulated rewards over time and
many training episodes. Thus, the only place actions are defined for an Agent is
in the `OnActionReceived()` function.

For example, if you designed an agent to move in two dimensions, you could use
either continuous or the discrete vector actions. In the continuous case, you
would set the vector action size to two (one for each dimension), and the
agent's Policy would create an action with two floating point values. In the
discrete case, you would use one Branch with a size of four (one for each
direction), and the Policy would create an action array containing a single
element with a value ranging from zero to three. Alternatively, you could create
two branches of size two (one for horizontal movement and one for vertical
movement), and the Policy would create an action array containing two elements
with values ranging from zero to one.

Note that when you are programming actions for an agent, it is often helpful to
test your action logic using the `Heuristic()` method of the Agent,
which lets you map keyboard
commands to actions.

The [3DBall](Learning-Environment-Examples.md#3dball-3d-balance-ball) and
[Area](Learning-Environment-Examples.md#push-block) example environments are set
up to use either the continuous or the discrete vector action spaces.

### Continuous Action Space

When an Agent uses a Policy set to the **Continuous** vector action space, the
action parameter passed to the Agent's `OnActionReceived()` function is an array with
length equal to the `Vector Action Space Size` property value.
The individual values in the array have whatever meanings that you ascribe to
them. If you assign an element in the array as the speed of an Agent, for
example, the training process learns to control the speed of the Agent through
this parameter.

The [Reacher example](Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) defines a
continuous action space with four control values.

![reacher](images/reacher.png)

These control values are applied as torques to the bodies making up the arm:

```csharp
public override void OnActionReceived(float[] act)
{
    float torque_x = Mathf.Clamp(act[0], -1, 1) * 100f;
    float torque_z = Mathf.Clamp(act[1], -1, 1) * 100f;
    rbA.AddTorque(new Vector3(torque_x, 0f, torque_z));

    torque_x = Mathf.Clamp(act[2], -1, 1) * 100f;
    torque_z = Mathf.Clamp(act[3], -1, 1) * 100f;
    rbB.AddTorque(new Vector3(torque_x, 0f, torque_z));
}
```

By default the output from our provided PPO algorithm pre-clamps the values of
`vectorAction` into the [-1, 1] range. It is a best practice to manually clip
these as well, if you plan to use a 3rd party algorithm with your environment.
As shown above, you can scale the control values as needed after clamping them.

### Discrete Action Space

When an Agent uses a  **Discrete** vector action space, the
action parameter passed to the Agent's `OnActionReceived()` function is an array
containing indices. With the discrete vector action space, `Branches` is an
array of integers, each value corresponds to the number of possibilities for
each branch.

For example, if we wanted an Agent that can move in an plane and jump, we could
define two branches (one for motion and one for jumping) because we want our
agent be able to move __and__ jump concurrently. We define the first branch to
have 5 possible actions (don't move, go left, go right, go backward, go forward)
and the second one to have 2 possible actions (don't jump, jump). The
`OnActionReceived()` method would look something like:

```csharp
// Get the action index for movement
int movement = Mathf.FloorToInt(act[0]);
// Get the action index for jumping
int jump = Mathf.FloorToInt(act[1]);

// Look up the index in the movement action list:
if (movement == 1) { directionX = -1; }
if (movement == 2) { directionX = 1; }
if (movement == 3) { directionZ = -1; }
if (movement == 4) { directionZ = 1; }
// Look up the index in the jump action list:
if (jump == 1 && IsGrounded()) { directionY = 1; }

// Apply the action results to move the Agent
gameObject.GetComponent<Rigidbody>().AddForce(
    new Vector3(
        directionX * 40f, directionY * 300f, directionZ * 40f));
```

Note that the above code example is a simplified extract from the AreaAgent
class, which provides alternate implementations for both the discrete and the
continuous action spaces.

#### Masking Discrete Actions

When using Discrete Actions, it is possible to specify that some actions are
impossible for the next decision. When the Agent is controlled by a
neural network, the Agent will be unable to perform the specified action. Note
that when the Agent is controlled by its Heuristic, the Agent will
still be able to decide to perform the masked action. In order to mask an
action,  override the `Agent.CollectDiscreteActionMasks()` virtual method, and call `DiscreteActionMasker.SetMask()` in it:

```csharp
public override void CollectDiscreteActionMasks(DiscreteActionMasker actionMasker){
    actionMasker.SetMask(branch, actionIndices)
}
```

Where:

* `branch` is the index (starting at 0) of the branch on which you want to mask
  the action
* `actionIndices` is a list of `int` corresponding to the
  indices of the actions that the Agent cannot perform.

For example, if you have an Agent with 2 branches and on the first branch
(branch 0) there are 4 possible actions : _"do nothing"_, _"jump"_, _"shoot"_
and _"change weapon"_. Then with the code bellow, the Agent will either _"do
nothing"_ or _"change weapon"_ for his next decision (since action index 1 and 2
are masked)

```csharp
SetMask(0, new int[2]{1,2})
```

Notes:

* You can call `SetMask` multiple times if you want to put masks on
  multiple branches.
* You cannot mask all the actions of a branch.
* You cannot mask actions in continuous control.

## Rewards

In reinforcement learning, the reward is a signal that the agent has done
something right. The PPO reinforcement learning algorithm works by optimizing
the choices an agent makes such that the agent earns the highest cumulative
reward over time. The better your reward mechanism, the better your agent will
learn.

**Note:** Rewards are not used during inference by an Agent using a
trained model and is also not used during imitation learning.

Perhaps the best advice is to start simple and only add complexity as needed. In
general, you should reward results rather than actions you think will lead to
the desired results. To help develop your rewards, you can use the Monitor class
to display the cumulative reward received by an Agent. You can even use the
Agent's Heuristic to control the Agent while watching how it accumulates rewards.

Allocate rewards to an Agent by calling the `AddReward()` method in the
`OnActionReceived()` function. The reward assigned between each decision
should be in the range [-1,1]. Values outside this range can lead to
unstable training. The `reward` value is reset to zero when the agent receives a
new decision. If there are multiple calls to `AddReward()` for a single agent
decision, the rewards will be summed together to evaluate how good the previous
decision was. There is a method called `SetReward()` that will override all
previous rewards given to an agent since the previous decision.

### Examples

You can examine the `OnActionReceived()` functions defined in the [example
environments](Learning-Environment-Examples.md) to see how those projects
allocate rewards.

The `GridAgent` class in the [GridWorld
example](Learning-Environment-Examples.md#gridworld) uses a very simple reward
system:

```csharp
Collider[] hitObjects = Physics.OverlapBox(trueAgent.transform.position,
                                           new Vector3(0.3f, 0.3f, 0.3f));
if (hitObjects.Where(col => col.gameObject.tag == "goal").ToArray().Length == 1)
{
    AddReward(1.0f);
    EndEpisode();
}
if (hitObjects.Where(col => col.gameObject.tag == "pit").ToArray().Length == 1)
{
    AddReward(-1f);
    EndEpisode();
}
```

The agent receives a positive reward when it reaches the goal and a negative
reward when it falls into the pit. Otherwise, it gets no rewards. This is an
example of a _sparse_ reward system. The agent must explore a lot to find the
infrequent reward.

In contrast, the `AreaAgent` in the [Area
example](Learning-Environment-Examples.md#push-block) gets a small negative
reward every step. In order to get the maximum reward, the agent must finish its
task of reaching the goal square as quickly as possible:

```csharp
AddReward( -0.005f);
MoveAgent(act);

if (gameObject.transform.position.y < 0.0f ||
    Mathf.Abs(gameObject.transform.position.x - area.transform.position.x) > 8f ||
    Mathf.Abs(gameObject.transform.position.z + 5 - area.transform.position.z) > 8)
{
    EndEpisode();
    AddReward(-1f);
}
```

The agent also gets a larger negative penalty if it falls off the playing
surface.

The `Ball3DAgent` in the
[3DBall](Learning-Environment-Examples.md#3dball-3d-balance-ball) takes a
similar approach, but allocates a small positive reward as long as the agent
balances the ball. The agent can maximize its rewards by keeping the ball on the
platform:

```csharp

SetReward(0.1f);

// When ball falls mark Agent as finished and give a negative penalty
if ((ball.transform.position.y - gameObject.transform.position.y) < -2f ||
    Mathf.Abs(ball.transform.position.x - gameObject.transform.position.x) > 3f ||
    Mathf.Abs(ball.transform.position.z - gameObject.transform.position.z) > 3f)
{
    SetReward(-1f);
    EndEpisode();

}
```

The `Ball3DAgent` also assigns a negative penalty when the ball falls off the
platform.

Note that all of these environments make use of the `EndEpisode()` method, which manually
terminates an episode when a termination condition is reached. This can be
called independently of the `Max Step` property.

## Agent Properties

![Agent Inspector](images/3dball_learning_brain.png)

* `Behavior Parameters` - The parameters dictating what Policy the Agent will
receive.
  * `Behavior Name` - The identifier for the behavior. Agents with the same behavior name
  will learn the same policy. If you're using [curriculum learning](Training-Curriculum-Learning.md),
   this is used as the top-level key in the config.
  * `Vector Observation`
    * `Space Size` - Length of vector observation for the Agent.
    * `Stacked Vectors` - The number of previous vector observations that will
      be stacked and used collectively for decision making. This results in the
      effective size of the vector observation being passed to the Policy being:
      _Space Size_ x _Stacked Vectors_.
  * `Vector Action`
    * `Space Type` - Corresponds to whether action vector contains a single
      integer (Discrete) or a series of real-valued floats (Continuous).
    * `Space Size` (Continuous) - Length of action vector.
    * `Branches` (Discrete) - An array of integers, defines multiple concurrent
      discrete actions. The values in the `Branches` array correspond to the
      number of possible discrete values for each action branch.
  * `Model` - The neural network model used for inference (obtained after
  training)
  * `Inference Device` - Whether to use CPU or GPU to run the model during inference
  * `Behavior Type` - Determines whether the Agent will do training, inference, or use its
  Heuristic() method:
    * `Default` - the Agent will train if they connect to a python trainer, otherwise they will perform inference.
    * `Heuristic Only` - the Agent will always use the `Heuristic()` method.
    * `Inference Only` - the Agent will always perform inference.
  * `Team ID` - Used to define the team for [self-play](Training-Self-Play.md)
  * `Use Child Sensors` - Whether to use all Sensor components attached to child GameObjects of this Agent.
* `Max Step` - The per-agent maximum number of steps. Once this number is
  reached, the Agent will be reset.

## Monitoring Agents

We created a helpful `Monitor` class that enables visualizing variables within a
Unity environment. While this was built for monitoring an agent's value function
throughout the training process, we imagine it can be more broadly useful. You
can learn more [here](Feature-Monitor.md).

## Destroying an Agent

You can destroy an Agent GameObject during the simulation. Make sure that there is
always at least one Agent training at all times by either spawning a new Agent
every time one is destroyed or by re-spawning new Agents when the whole environment
resets.
